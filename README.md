# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I deployed this repository to learn about JQuery and Day.js. The basic code for the website was provided by a Bootcamp course. I create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
I learn:  
    - how to use Dayjs.    
    - how to rename a repository.
