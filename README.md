# Password Generator

## Description

I deployed this repository to learn about Javascript. The basic code for the website was provided by a Bootcamp course. I implemented an algoritm to generate a password according to the criteria chosen by the user. I used dialogs to ask the user about his/her choices. 
I learn:  
    - how to display a dialog with an optional message, "window.prompts".  
    - how to display a dialog with an optional message, and to wait until the user either confirms or cancels the dialog, "window.confirm".   
    - How to display a dialog with an optional message, and to wait until the user dismisses the dialog: "window.alert".
    - How to use Math object to select randomly a number.
